This email is to confirm that "<%= @subscription.subscriber.name %>" has been scheduled to be downgraded to the free Engage Plan. Your account will be switched over to your new plan on <%= @subscription.next_renewal_at.to_date.to_formatted_s(:long_ordinal)%>. Until then, you'll remain on the <%=@subscription.plan.name%> plan. 

If this was done in error, you can visit your account to return to keep your paid plan. 

Thank you for using IMPACT!
