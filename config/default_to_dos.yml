    :description: "Images make a website, please <a href='/businesses/<%= @business.id %>/content/images_upload/new' target='_blank'>upload initial images</a>, you can always add more later. Things to keep in mind: images should be larger than 1200px on each side so we can downscale them if needed and only .jpg, .jpeg, .gif or .png file types are supported. Images from smartphones are fine. Pro Tip: If you name the files something descriptive prior to uploading them rather than 1234.jpg or 2015-03-07 07.48.01.jpg it will help with search engines."

    :description: "In order to help your site reflect you and your business we need to get a sense of what you like and don’t like. To start, share what you like and don't like about your current website. Next, if you have any websites you like and would like to emulate share those with us too - it’s important you share what you like i.e. I like the way the images go full width and the main image is actually a carousel."
